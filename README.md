# TIC-TAC-TOE

This python project has been build over a simple idea of creating a product that offers something well-known in a terminal format.

TIC-TAC-TOE is as the name suggests, a tic tac toe game where the user plays against the computer to win.

TIC-TAC-TOE was created for my Milestone Project 3 in the Full Stack Web Development course I am currently undertaking at Code Institute.
