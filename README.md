# TIC-TAC-TOE

This python project has been build over a simple idea of creating a product that offers something well-known in a terminal format.

TIC-TAC-TOE is as the name suggests, a tic tac toe game where the user plays against the computer to win.

TIC-TAC-TOE was created for my Milestone Project 3 in the Full Stack Web Development course I am currently undertaking at Code Institute.

# How to play

TIC-TAC-TOE is a very simple and straightforward game. This version of it allows you to only play against the computer and not against another player. 

To play you have to select a number from 1 to 9, anthing under or over will prompt you to insert the number again.
The player can only input numbers, no letters or other special characters are allowed.
The player plays as X and the computer plays as O.
First to reach 3 X's or O's wins, otherwise the game is a tie.
